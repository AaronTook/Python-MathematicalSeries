# Python-MathematicalSeries
A Python module with classes representing Arithmetic and Geometric Series, each of which contains methods regarding computations for the respective series.

Project Requirements:
1. Python math module. Comes pre-installed with the Python Standard Library
2. Included main.py file. This is the only required file for full access to functionality.

ArithmeticSeries class methods:
<ul>
  <li>
    getSumWithLastTerm(n, A_1, A_n)
    This method gets the sum of the Arithmetic series with <strong>n</strong> terms, <strong>A_1</strong> as its first term and <strong>A_n</strong> as its last term.
  </li>
  <li>
    getSumWithD(n, A_1, d)
    This method gets the sum of the Arithmetic series with <strong>n</strong> terms, <strong>A_1</strong> as its first term and <strong>d</strong> as its common difference.
  </li>
  <li>
    getN(A_1, A_n, d)
    This method gets the number of terms of the Arithmetic series with <strong>A_1</strong> as its first term, <strong>A_n</strong> as its last term, and <strong>d</strong> as its common difference.
  </li>
</ul>

GeometricSeries class methods:
<ul>
  <li>
    getSum(n, A_1, A_n)
    This method gets the sum of the Geometric series with <strong>n</strong> terms, <strong>A_1</strong> as its first term and <strong>A_n</strong> as its last term.
  </li>
  <li>
    getN(A_1, A_n, r)
    This method gets the number of terms of the Geometric series with <strong>A_1</strong> as its first term, <strong>A_n</strong> as its last term, and <strong>r</strong> as its common ratio.
  </li>
</ul>
